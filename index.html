      <p> Both the World and the Wired are incredibly noisy; They incessantly distract
	us with petty annoyances and pleasures, so much so that it's often very
	hard to stop and observe the world as we find it. <br> <br>
	To encourage this observation, I have created this little website to document
	my observations and interpretations of these two overlapping realms.
